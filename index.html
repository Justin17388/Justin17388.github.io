    <h2>About Zensory Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Justin and I am married to a therapist. I got into 3D printing about a year ago. After printing several Star Wars ships and synth parts,<br>
      I started test making small toys and props for our kids and friends. Our youngest daughter has ADHD and had some issues picking at her nails,<br>
      so my wife suggested I print her a fidget ring. She loved it and has since stopped picking.<br><br>

      I started printing other types of sensory toys not just for her, but for my wife's practice to give out at conventions. It was at those conventions that I realized how much help<br>
      these items could be to therapists, their clients, and other parents. These fidgets help those with anxiety, ADHD, autism, and more.<br><br>

      So check us out and see what we can do for you. We have multiple standard products and the ability to make specific custom items if needed.<br><br>
