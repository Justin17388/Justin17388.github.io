    <h2>About Zensory Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Justinâ€”husband to a licensed therapist, dad of three, and the guy behind Zensory Solutions. I discovered 3D printing about a year ago and started out making Star Wars ships and synthesizer parts just for fun. Over time, that hobby evolved into something much more meaningful.<br><br>

      Our youngest daughter has ADHD and used to struggle with picking at her nails. At my wifeâ€™s suggestion, I printed her a small fidget ring. She loved itâ€”and more importantly, it helped her break the habit. That moment sparked the idea to create other sensory-friendly tools, first for our family, then for my wifeâ€™s therapy practice.<br><br>

      When we started sharing these tools at mental health conferences, we saw just how much they resonated with therapists, counselors, and parents. Fidgets and sensory aids aren't just toysâ€”theyâ€™re supportive tools for managing anxiety, ADHD, autism, and other sensory needs.<br><br>

      Today, Zensory Solutions offers a growing collection of custom-designed sensory aids, play kits, and fidget items. Whether you're looking for something standard or a custom solution, Iâ€™m here to help.<br><br>

      ðŸ›’ A full online store is coming soon, but in the meantime, feel free to reach out and place an order through our Facebook page below. Thanks for stopping byâ€”weâ€™re glad you're here.
