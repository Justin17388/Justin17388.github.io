      <p>
        A little bit about us: <br>
        My name is Justin and I am married to a therapist. I got into 3D printing about a year ago. After printing several Star Wars ships and synth parts,<br>
        I started test making small toys and props for our kids and friends. Our youngest daughter has ADHD and had some issues picking at her nails<br>
        so my wife suggested I print her a fidget ring. She loved it and has since stopped picking. I started printing other types of sensory<br>
        toys not just for her, but for my wife's practice to give out at conventions. It was at those conventions that I realized how much help<br>
        these items could be to therapists, their clients, and other parents. These fidgets help those with anxiety, ADHD, autism, and so much more.<br>
        So check us out and see what we can do for you. We have multiple standard products and the ability to make specific custom items if needed.<br>
        Shopping Cart and order options coming soon. For now, please use the Facebook link.<br>
