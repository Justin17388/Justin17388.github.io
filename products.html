    <h2>About Zensory Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Justin and I am married to a therapist. I got into 3D printing about a year ago. After printing several Star Wars ships and synth parts,<br>
      I started test making small toys and props for our kids and friends. Our youngest daughter has ADHD and had some issues picking at her nails,<br>
      so my wife suggested I print her a fidget ring. She loved it and has since stopped picking.<br><br>

      I started printing other types of sensory toys not just for her, but for my wife's practice to give out at conventions. It was at those conventions that I realized how much help<br>
      these items could be to therapists, their clients, and other parents. These fidgets help those with anxiety, ADHD, autism, and more.<br><br>

      So check us out and see what we can do for you. We have multiple standard products and the ability to make specific custom items if needed.<br><br>

Please help me clean this up. I feel like it isnt quite right. I want it to be heartfelt and down to earth but also not sound like i am rambling or simple. I also want it to be more uniform looking.

Absolutely‚Äîlet's refine that for tone and clarity while keeping it heartfelt, genuine, and professionally readable.

Here‚Äôs a polished version of your bio that balances warmth and professionalism:

<p>
  Hi, I'm Justin‚Äîhusband to a licensed therapist, dad of two, and the guy behind Zensory Solutions. I discovered 3D printing about a year ago and started out making Star Wars ships and synthesizer parts just for fun. Over time, that hobby evolved into something much more meaningful.<br><br>

  Our youngest daughter has ADHD and used to struggle with picking at her nails. At my wife‚Äôs suggestion, I printed her a small fidget ring. She loved it‚Äîand more importantly, it helped her break the habit. That moment sparked the idea to create other sensory-friendly tools, first for our family, then for my wife‚Äôs therapy practice.<br><br>

  When we started sharing these tools at mental health conferences, we saw just how much they resonated with therapists, counselors, and parents. Fidgets and sensory aids aren't just toys‚Äîthey‚Äôre supportive tools for managing anxiety, ADHD, autism, and other sensory needs.<br><br>

  Today, Zensory Solutions offers a growing collection of custom-designed sensory aids, play kits, and fidget items. Whether you're looking for something standard or a custom solution, I‚Äôm here to help.<br><br>

  üõí A full online store is coming soon, but in the meantime, feel free to reach out and place an order through our Facebook page below. Thanks for stopping by‚Äîwe‚Äôre glad you're here.
</p>
üí° Why this works:
Clear structure: Introduces you, the origin story, impact, then a call to action.

Professional tone with warmth: Still personal, but not overly casual or rambling.

Uniform formatting: Clean <br><br> spacing between paragraphs for readability.

Heart: Keeps the emotional core without sounding unpolished.

Would you like this version pasted directly into your site code, or want help matching this tone for a product description or intro message too?
